These are based on the Illustris Project hydrodynamical simulations:
Lightcone image presented by: Vogelsberger et al. 2014
Lightcone application for hydro sims described by: Snyder et al. 2017
Mock HST and JWST machinery supported by HST#13887

FITS files contain the following HDUs:
0-"IMAGE_NOPSF":  Raw image without PSF or noise.  Header documented below.
1-"IMAGE_PSF"  :  [Optional] Same image, now convolved with model PSF from TinyTim or WebbPSF.
2-"MODELPSF"   :  [Optional] The PSF model at the same pixel scale as HDUs 0 and 1
3-"Catalog"    :  Lightcone Catalog, containing intrinsic simulation info, including galaxy ID numbers and image positions

In HDU 0-"IMAGE_NOPSF", the header contains the following useful cards, for example:
FILTER  = 'jwst-nircam_f200w'                                                   
PIXSIZE =               0.0317 / arcsec                                         
UNIT    = 'nanoJanskies'       / per pixel                                      
ABZP    =    31.40006562228223 / AB mag zeropoint                               
PHOTFNU =             2.64E-08 / Jy; approx flux[Jy] at 1 count/sec             
EXTNAME = 'IMAGE_NOPSF'  

These values, especially PHOTFNU, are highly approximate and should be confirmed by the user using an ETC before applying to any analyses.

For HDUs 1-2, I produced these only for HST and JWST filters, as I have not yet fully propagated the WFIRST filters and PSF characteristics. These might be a good test bed for "in-situ" data simulation methods.  Also it might make sense to wait for the hardware to stabilize a bit more before fully installing these assumptions in a pipeline.
