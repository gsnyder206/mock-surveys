The code in this folder has been written to run in the Jupyter Lab enviorment
provided by the illustris-tng simulation team. Details for creating an account
and requesting access to a Jupyter Lab enviorment can be found at

Each of the lightcone catalog generation scrips,
"tng_lightcone_catalogX.0.py" provides diffrent functionality.
1.0 is the original version of the script, best used on local data.
2.0 is optimized for the Jupyter Lab enviorment, with little functional change from the user perspective.
3.0 is experimental and untested. If it works, it should be the most resource-effecient implementation of the code,
but it's currently outside the scope of my current project.
